A Multistage graph is a directed, weighted graph in which the nodes can be divided into a set of stages such that all edges are from a stage to next stage only (In other words there is no edge between vertices of same stage and from a vertex of current stage to previous stage).

The vertices of a multistage graph are divided into n number of disjoint subsets S = { S1 , S2 , S3 ……….. Sn },  where S1 is the source and Sn is the sink 
(destination). The cardinality of S1 and Sn are equal to 1. i.e., |S1| = |Sn| = 1.
We are given a multistage graph, a source and a destination, we need to find shortest path from source to destination. By convention, we consider source at stage 1 and destination as last stage.


// CPP program to find shortest distance
// in a multistage graph.
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define N 8
#define INF INT_MAX

// Returns shortest distance from 0 to
// N-1.
int shortestDist(int graph[N][N]) {

	// dist[i] is going to store shortest
	// distance from node i to node N-1.
	int dist[N];

	dist[N-1] = 0;

	// Calculating shortest path for
	// rest of the nodes
	for (int i = N-2 ; i >= 0 ; i--)
	{

		// Initialize distance from i to
		// destination (N-1)
		dist[i] = INF;

		// Check all nodes of next stages
		// to find shortest distance from
		// i to N-1.
		for (int j = i ; j < N ; j++)
		{
			// Reject if no edge exists
			if (graph[i][j] == INF)
				continue;

			// We apply recursive equation to
			// distance to target through j.
			// and compare with minimum distance
			// so far.
			dist[i] = min(dist[i], graph[i][j] +
										dist[j]);
		}
	}

	return dist[0];
}
